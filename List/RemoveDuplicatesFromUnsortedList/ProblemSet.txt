Remove Duplicates from Unsorted List
Question
Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list - GeeksforGeeks
Write a removeDuplicates() function which takes a list and deletes
any duplicate nodes from the list. The list is not sorted.
For example if the linked list is 12->11->12->21->41->43->21,
then removeDuplicates() should convert the list to 12->11->21->41->43.
If temporary buffer is not allowed, how to solve it?
