Triangle - Find the minimum path sum from top to bottom
Question
lintcode: (109) Triangle
Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move
to adjacent numbers on the row below.
Note
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the tota
l number of rows in the triangle.
Example
For example, given the following triangle
[
[2],
[3,4],
[6,5,7],
[4,1,8,3]
] T
he minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
