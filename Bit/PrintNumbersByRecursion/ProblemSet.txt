Print Numbers by Recursion
Question
lintcode: (371) Print Numbers by Recursion
Print numbers from 1 to the largest number with N digits by recursion.
Example
Given N = 1, return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
Given N = 2, return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,...,99].
Note
It's pretty easy to do recursion like:
recursion(i) {
if i > largest number:
return
results.add(i)
recursion(i + 1)
} h
owever this cost a lot of recursion memory as the recursion depth maybe very large.
Can you do it in another way to recursive with at most N depth?
Challenge
Do it in recursion, not for-loop.
