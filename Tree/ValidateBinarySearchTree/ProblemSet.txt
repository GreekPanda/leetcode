Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
Assume a BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
A single node tree is a BST
Example
An example:
2
/ \
1 4
/ \
3 5
The above binary tree is serialized as {2,1,4,#,#,3,5} (in level order).
